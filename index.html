# ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Aadya  
Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying Computer Science and Data Science.
My main interests include:
- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning  
- Web Development & Design  
- Engineering + Creative Problem Solving  
- Exploring how technology impacts communities  

I enjoy taking on projects that combine creativity with technical skills - check out the [Projects](/projects/) page to see what Iâ€™ve been working on.

# ðŸŒ± Outside Life
When Iâ€™m not coding or studying, you'll find me playing volleyball (I've been playing for over eight years) . Some of my other hobbies include reading (I  have a book podcast where I talk about upcoming books and my opinions on them) and running. 

Hopefully, this website gives you a glimpse into the work I love, the ideas that excite me, and more about who I am.

I like balancing technical work with hobbies that keep me grounded and inspired.
