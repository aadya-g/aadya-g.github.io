# ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Aadya  
Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Roll Badge!) studying Computer Science and Data Science.
My main interests include:  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** studying how they learn, adapt, and can be fine-tuned for real-world applications.  
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** exploring how agents can learn optimal strategies through trial and error.  
- **Computer Vision (CV):** applying deep learning to image recognition, object detection, and visual understanding. 

I grew up in the Bay Area, surrounded by innovation and creativity, which sparked my curiosity about technology from an early age. That curiosity has led me to pursue Computer Science and Data Science at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, where Iâ€™ve had the chance to explore a wide range of projects and ideas
Research and interdisciplinary learning opportunities have been a hallmark of my experience, whether itâ€™s building AI tools to simplify real-world tasks, analyzing data to uncover patterns, or experimenting with web projects that combine design and functionality. I love diving into challenges that sit at the intersection of technology, creativity, and problem-solving.

# ðŸŒ± Outside Life
When Iâ€™m not coding or studying, youâ€™ll find me:  
- **Volleyball:** Iâ€™ve been playing for over eight years, and itâ€™s one of my favorite ways to stay active and competitive.  
- **Reading:** I actually also run a book podcast where I share my thoughts on upcoming releases and review stories that inspire me.  
- **Running:** I enjoy running as both a way to clear my mind and to challenge myself physically.  
- **Community & Relationships:** Spending time with friends, family, and my community is an important part of my life.

Hopefully, this website gives you a glimpse into the work I love, the ideas that excite me, and more about who I am.
